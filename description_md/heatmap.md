## Where do the workers live and work?

How many people are working from/to each district? The following heatmap helps you grasp a quick understanding
about the travel pattern. The vertical axis list the districts workers are living in, and the horizontal axis 
list the working location, classified by districts. Each square in the plot refers to the number of workers 
**living** in that *row* and **working** in that *column*. *Darker the colour* of the square, **more workers** 
belongs to that living/working place group.

Hover over the coloured grids to check how many workers are in that living/working place pattern.
