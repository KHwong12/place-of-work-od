Commuting to work is usually not something pleasant. Maybe the work from home culture has changed our 
understanding of "commuting to work", but the general pattern of commuting does not change drastically. With around 
3,000,000 workers (2.858 million, to be more accurate) living and working across the whole territory 
of Hong Kong, how does the pattern of the commuting flows looks like?
