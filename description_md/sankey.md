## The flow of workers

The chart below is a **sankey diagram**. The two sides of the chart resembles a stacked bar chart showing the total 
number of workers. The rectangles on left classify the workers by their place of residence. Those rectangles on 
the right classify in terms of the place of work.
  
In the middle, there have a bunch of 'flows' meandering from left to right. Each flow represents an place of 
living/working pair from the selected place of residence and work. The thicker the flow, the more workers are 
in that living/working location pair. The color of the flows are classified according to the location of place of
residence and work as fellows: 

- <mark style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#4daf4a">Same area (Hong Kong Island/Kowloon/New Territories)</mark>
- <mark style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#377eb8">Between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon</mark>
- <mark style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#ff7f00">Between Hong Kong Island and New Territories</mark>
- <mark style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#984ea3">Between Kowloon and New Territories</mark>

Hover and click over the flows to check how many workers are in that living/working place pattern.
