## The flow of workers

The chart below is a **sankey diagram**. The two sides of the chart resembles two stacked bar charts showing the total number of workers. The bar on *left* group the workers by their **living place**, while the *right* group by their **working place**.

In the middle, there have a bunch of 'flows' meandering from left to right. Each flow represents a combination of living and working place. The *thicker* the flow, the **more workers** are in that living/working location pair. The *colour* of the flows are classified according to their travel patterns as follows: 

- <mark style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#4daf4a">Same area (Hong Kong Island/Kowloon/New Territories)</mark>
- <mark style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#377eb8">Between Hong Kong Island and Kowloon</mark>
- <mark style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#ff7f00">Between Hong Kong Island and New Territories</mark>
- <mark style="color:#ffffff; background-color:#984ea3">Between Kowloon and New Territories</mark>

Hover and click over the flows to check how many workers are in that living/working place combination.
